    <h2>About the Detroit Lions</h2>
    <p>The Detroit Lions are a professional NFL team that hasnt had success since before the Super Bowl Era. This team has gone 30 years without a division title, and hasnt won a playoff game since 1992. With the additions of a new coaching staff which includes Dan Campbell, the head coach, among other amazing coaches, and many new young stars, the lions look to break this losing mentality in the 2023 season</p>
    <p>The Detroit Lions are 5-1 this season and #4 in the power rankings. How far will this team go and will they be able to win the divison and a playoff game this season?</p>
