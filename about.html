    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Jackson Hefke and im a junior studying information science. Another thing about me is im a huge Detroit Lions fan. I have been watching the Lions since I was 10 years old, and we have always been a terrible team, but this year is different(I hope). Other than watching football, I like to play videogames, play sports, and hangout with friends. I grew up in Milford Michigan which is about 45 minutes east of MSU campus. Growing up I was never a MSU fan, actually, I was a big UofM fan growing up. I ended up chosing state becuase one, I didnt get into UofM, and two, I liked the campus and community of East Lansing more than Ann Arbor. This Blog is about the Detroit Lions recent sucess, along with some information about their sad history.</p>
