        <p>The Detroit Lions are an NFL team founded in 1930, and since the founding of this team, there has been little to no success. Before the super bowl era the Lions won in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. Since the first Super Bowl in 1967, the Lions have only won one playoff game and have became one of the worst franchises in the NFL.</p>
