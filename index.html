      <h3>The Sad History of the Lions</h3>

        <p>The Detroit Lions are an NFL team founded in 1930, and since the founding of this team, there has been little to no success. Before the Super Bowl era, the Lions won in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. Since the first Super Bowl in 1967, the Lions have only won one playoff game and have become one of the worst franchises in the NFL. In the past, the Lions have had Hall of Fame and NFL record-holding players such as Calvin Johnson, and Barry Sanders. Even with these star players the Lions were still never able to bring home or even make it to the Superbowl. In 2008, the Detroit Lions were the first NFL team to have an 0-16 season. Time and time again the lions disappoint their fans with losing season after losing season. In 2020, Martha Ford stepped down as the owner of the Lions and passed the role onto her daughter, Sheila Ford. With this ownership change came a shift in the organization. Dan Campbell was appointed to be the new coach in January 2021 and a new GM Brad Holmes was also hired around the same time. With lots of solid draft picks and developing players, can the Lions finally become a winning team?</p>

      <h3>The 2023 Detroit Lions</h3>

      <p>Since 2016, the Lions have drafted several key elements to their team. Some players include Taylor Decker and Graham Glasnow in 2016, Frank Ragnow and Tracy Walker in 2018, Penei Sewell and Amon-Ra St.Brown, amongst many others. Through solid drafts and good development the Lions have created one of the top offenses in the NFL along with a very solid defense. Even though the Lions have a very strong team, the team culture is what makes the lions a contender this year. Dan Campbell talks all the time about how important culture is and how every member of the team needs to be there for their teammates.So far this year the Lions have suffered a lot of injuries including CJ Gardner-Johnson and Emmanuel Moseley who are out for the season. Even with these key players lost the Lions have still found a way to a 5-2 record, even beating the reigning Super Bowl champs the Chiefs on opening night.  The Lions have the 15th hardest schedule this year but with the team they've built and the poor play by the other division teams, the Lions have a very good chance of making the playoffs for the first time since 2016.</p>
